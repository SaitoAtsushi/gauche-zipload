This is a library for Gauche.
You can load directly from the ZIP archive by using the procedures in this library.

* Prerequisites

This module is using some features that are added after Gauche 0.9.3 release.

* Install

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ git clone git://github.com/SaitoAtsushi/gauche-zipload.git
    $ cd gauche-zipload
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ [sudo] make install
#+END_SRC

* A simple example

When the following three files is contained in a ZIP archive FOO.zip

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; T1.scm
(load "T2")
(load "T3")
(define (test-zipload) (list a b))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; T2.scm
(define a 'a)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
;; T3.scm
(define b 'b)
#+END_SRC

to load the T1 from this archive, run following.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(add-load-zip "FOO.zip")
(load "T1")
#+END_SRC

Calling add-load-zip with ZIP archive path is similar to call add-load-path with directory.
